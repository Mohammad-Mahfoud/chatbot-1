Intent classification using a simple feedforward neural network

Natural Language Processing with NLTK (tokenization + lemmatization)

Trainable on a custom intents.json file

Supports function triggers (e.g., showing stock info)

Requirements
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
NLTK
NumPy

This is just a simple project to understand DL and NLP .
